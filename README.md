Learning the Red language: links, examples and practice

Documentation
======

Rebol
------
[Rebol Core Concepts](http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore.html): The orginal forebear of the Red language; mostly valid, but it's better to compare with the Red-By-Example page to be sure.
> "This guide provides the basic information necessary for using REBOL/Core. It assumes that the reader is already familiar with general programming and operating system terminology and concepts."

[Rebol Programming Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rebol_programming): An all-round reference to Rebol, especially the View and VID dialects.  LOts of links to other documentation pages and sites.
> "This book covers the basics of Rebol programming, what Rebol actually does and why it's designed the way it is. It's not a reference manual and therefore doesn't contain a complete overview of all functions, but aims to teach the mechanics and principles of the language to give you a deeper understanding of it."

[The Easiest Porgramming Language: Rebol](http://easiestprogramminglanguage.com/easiest_programming_language.html):
> "REBOL is the easiest computer programming language to learn.
> REBOL is a tiny (1/2 megabyte) interpreter that uses "Domain Specific Language" (DSL) technology and a combination of other truly unique syntax and design strategies to make simple work of every imaginable coding task. Compare this tutorial to texts about any other programming language, and you'll quickly discover that REBOL is a remarkably concise and practical tool, regardless of your skill level. For immediately productive development, there is nothing else like REBOL, anywhere."

[Rebol Quickstart Tutorial - Part 2](http://re-bol.com/rebol_quick_start_part2.html)

[Creating Business Apps with Rebol](http://business-programming.com/business_programming.html): a vast tutorial full of examples and mini-apps, showing how Rebol can be used for business programming.

[Rebol Bindology](http://blog.revolucent.net/2009/07/deep-rebol-bindology.html?m=1): understanding how the Word object binding works.

[rebol.org](http://rebol.org/): many links and Rebol scripts contributed by users over the years.

Red
------
[Red-By-Example](http://www.red-by-example.org/): currently the best reference to the Red language.  Provides a list of all Red words, concepts and functions, and an example of their usage.  Regularly updated.

[Getting Started With Red](http://redprogramming.com/Getting%20Started.html): Red fundamentals; a nice straight-forward tutorial.

[Short Red Code Examples](http://redprogramming.com/Short%20Red%20Code%20Examples.html): Some useful examples to accompany the tutorial above.

[Official Red -lang Documentation](http://doc.red-lang.org): The official red-language documentation site, quite bare at the moment but improving.  View and VID are well covered.

[Beginners reference guide](http://www.mycode4fun.co.uk/red-beginners-reference-guide): a few specific coding examples. 
> "The idea of this guide is to give a quick reference to  gui level programmers.
It is not extensive and more will be added as and when I get chance.
My aim is to keep it simple. Remember it's not just about seasoned programmers.
Novice programmers and students WILL be put off by over complicated Terminology.
Examples are in no particular order."

[Red discussion on Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/red-lang): not to active yet, but a good place to get an answer from those who know Red well including some developers. 

[Red Gitter discussion sites](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Gitter-Room-Index): a list of various Gitter chat rooms, for developers,  users, documentions,  etc. 

[Red Commandline Options](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/README.md): mainly how to compile a Red executable.

[Red Code Examples](https://github.com/red/code): a few mainly GUI code examples, plus a couple for the new React feature.

[Red Parse Dialect](http://www.red-lang.org/2013/11/041-introducing-parse.html): a tutorial and how-to page.
